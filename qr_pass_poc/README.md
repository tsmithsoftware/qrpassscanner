# qr_pass_poc

A POC for QR code reading/validation

## Aim
To have an application which reads a QR code, communicates with an API and then displays:</br>
<ul>
<li>Picture</li>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Pass number</li>
</ul>
Wiremock API definition can be found in the /api directory. To set up, please run the wiremock.jar.
